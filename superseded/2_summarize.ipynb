MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\n\\nTHE LEGAL AGREEMENTS SET OUT BELOW ARE BETWEEN YOU AND ITUNES SARL (“ITUNES\") AND GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE (THE “STORES”).

THIS AGREEMENT APPLIES WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO SOFTWARE LICENCES THAT YOU MAY HAVE ENTERED INTO, SUCH AS FOR THE USE OF THE ITUNES APPLICATION.\\n\\nFOR MORE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PLEASE VISIT http://www.apple.com/support/.\\n\\nA. ITUNES STORE, MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS OF SALE\\n\\nPAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY\\n\\nYou agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Stores, and that iTunes may charge your payment method for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. You are responsible for the timely payment of all fees and for providing iTunes with a valid payment method for payment of all fees. For details of how purchases are billed please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582. You agree to receipt of all invoices in an electronic format, which may include email.\\n\\nYour total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable VAT (in effect on the day of download). By using the United Kingdom store you are specifying that as your country of residence for tax purposes.\\n\\nRight of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days from when you received your receipt without giving any reason, except iTunes Gifts which cannot be refunded once you have redeemed the code.\\n\\nTo cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision. To ensure immediate processing we recommend you use Report a Problem to cancel all items with the exception of iTunes Match, Season Pass, Multi-Pass and, unless purchased from a third party or redeemed, iTunes Gifts and Allowances, which can be cancelled by contacting iTunes Support. You also have the right to inform us using the model cancellation form below or by making any other clear statement. If you use Report a Problem we will communicate acknowledgement of receipt of your cancellation to you without delay.\\n\\nTo meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has expired.\\n\\nEffects of cancellation: We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your cancellation notice. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the transaction, and you will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.\\n\\nException to the right of cancellation: You cannot cancel your order for the supply of digital content if the delivery has started upon your request and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your cancellation right.\\n\\nModel cancellation form:\\n\\n- To iTunes S.à r.l., 31-33, rue Sainte Zithe, L-2763 Luxembourg:\\n\\n- I hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract for the following: [INSERT ORDER ID, ITEM, ARTIST AND TYPE]\\n\\n- Ordered on [INSERT DATE] / received on [INSERT DATE]\\n\\n- Name of consumer\\n\\n- Address of consumer\\n\\n- Date\\n\\nUntil a purchase is made, iTunes reserves the right to change prices for products offered via the Stores at any time, and the Stores do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering subsequent to purchase.\\n\\nIf a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is likely to be limited to a refund of the price paid for the unavailable product. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by iTunes.\\n\\n1-Click®\\n\\n1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Stores with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the Stores on your computer, 1-Click purchasing may be activated via the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account information). When accessing the Stores on your Apple-branded products running iOS such as an iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone (“iOS Device”), 1-Click is activated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes your transaction without any further steps.\\n\\nGIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS AND CODES, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES\\n\\nGift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances, in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and, cannot be returned for a cash refund (except as set out in our refund policy above that is applicable in the event the item has been purchased from the iTunes Store; or except if the retailer from which the item has been purchased applies a different refund policy), without prejudice to any applicable statutory right to a refund in case of faulty or misdescribed gifts; exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts, Gift Certificates, or iTunes Cards or Codes; used to provide Allowances; used for purchases on the Apple Online Store; or used in Apple Retail Stores. Unused balances are not transferable.\\n\\nGift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances purchased in the United Kingdom may be redeemed through the Stores only in the United Kingdom.\\n\\niTunes is not responsible for lost or stolen Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, or Allowances. Risk of loss and title for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, and Allowances that are transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser in the United Kingdom upon electronic transmission. Risk of loss and title for Content Codes that are transmitted electronically pass from iTunes in Luxembourg upon electronic transmission.\\n\\niTunes reserves the right to close accounts and request alternative forms of payment if a Gift Certificate, iTunes Card and Codes, Content Code, or Allowance is fraudulently obtained or used on the Stores.\\n\\nGIFTS\\n\\nGifts purchased from the Stores may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, persons in the United Kingdom. Gift recipients must have compatible hardware and parental control settings to utilize some gifts.\\n\\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\\n\\nTo avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during your use of the products offered through the Stores, you should always take frequent breaks, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including but not limited to while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before using the products offered through the Stores if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop using such products immediately and see a doctor if they occur during your use of such products. Parents should monitor their children’s use of the products offered through the Stores for signs of symptoms.\\n\\nPRE-ORDERS\\n\\nBy pre-ordering products, you are authorizing the Stores to automatically charge your account and, if you have enabled automatic downloads, download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order anytime prior to the time the item becomes available and as set out in our refund policy above.\\n\\nFAMILY SHARING\\n\\nFamily Sharing allows you to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products with up to six members (including yourself) of a “Family.” If you set up or join a Family, you may view the eligible products of other Family members and download such products to your compatible device or computer. You can also choose to hide purchases so that other Family members will not be able to view or download them from you. You can share information such as photos and videos via the Photo app, events via your Family Calendar, reminders via the Reminders app, location information via Find My Friends, and device location via Find My iPhone. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only. iTunes and iCloud accounts are required; iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family. Certain transactions and features may not be compatible with earlier software and may require a software upgrade. If you join a Family, the features of Family Sharing are enabled on your compatible devices and computers automatically.\\n\\nThe “Organiser” of a Family can invite other members to participate in the Family. The Organiser must be 18 years or older and must have an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13. The Organiser\\'s payment method is used to pay for any purchase initiated by a Family member in excess of any store credit in such initiating Family member’s account. Family members are acting as agents for the Organiser when the Organiser\\'s payment method is used. Products are associated with the account of the Family member who initiated the transaction. BY INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO JOIN A FAMILY, THE ORGANISER AGREES THAT ALL CHARGES FOR PURCHASES INITIATED BY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE AUTHORISED BY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ORGANISER, EVEN IF THE ORGANISER WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, IF A FAMILY MEMBER EXCEEDED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY AS GRANTED BY THE ORGANISER, OR IF MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS INITIATE PURCHASES FOR THE SAME PRODUCT. THE ORGANISER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY AGREEMENT WITH ITS PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER, AND ASSUMES ALL RISK IN THE EVENT THAT SHARING ACCESS TO SUCH PAYMENT METHOD LIMITS ANY PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER. The Organiser can change the payment method on file at any time. A record of the purchase will be sent to the initiating Family member and the Organiser, even if the purchase is hidden by the Family member; please use Report a Problem on your receipt if you or your Family members do not recognise charges on your receipt or payment method statement.\\n\\nThe Organiser can use the Ask to Buy function to require children under the age of 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser, and/or other adults designated by the Organiser, to download free or paid products before a purchase or download commences. Products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you and/or any adult designee is the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite; product purchase or download requests from earlier software may present users with an alternative permission process or prevent purchases altogether, and may require a software upgrade. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from a delay in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.\\n\\nThe Organiser may remove any Family member from the Family, which will terminate that Family member\\'s ability to initiate authorised purchases on the Organiser\\'s payment method, and that Family Member’s ability to view and share other Family members\\' products and information. When a Family member leaves or is removed from a Family, or the Organiser\\'s Apple ID is terminated for any reason, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to view or download the departing member’s products or information, or access products previously downloaded from the departing Family member, including purchases made on the Organiser\\'s payment method while the departing member was part of the Family. Similarly, if you leave a Family, you may no longer be able to view or download the products or information of the other Family members, and products that you downloaded from other Family members while a member of the Family may no longer be accessible. If you have made In-App Purchases from an app originally purchased by a departed Family member or downloaded from a Family member and you no longer belong to the Family, you need to purchase the app yourself and restore the In-App Purchases to regain access to them; please review the developer’s policies and the section of this Agreement entitled “In-App Purchases” before buying In-App Purchases. Because personal accounts for users under age 13 can only be created as part of Family Sharing, deleting such an account in order to remove it from the Family will terminate that Family member’s Apple ID and his or her ability to access any Apple services that require an Apple ID or any content associated with that Apple ID.\\n\\nYou can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the store account you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must use the same iTunes Store country or region. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded from the iTunes Store on up to 10 devices per account, only five of which can be computers; eligible apps can be downloaded to any devices the Family member owns or controls. Not all products, including In-App Purchases, content that is not available for re-download, subscriptions, and some previously purchased apps, are eligible for Family Sharing. Apple reserves the right to disband a Family in accordance with the “Termination” section of this Agreement.\\n\\nELECTRONIC CONTRACTING\\n\\nYour use of the Stores includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions you enter into on this site, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts and applications. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.\\n\\niTunes is not responsible for typographic errors.\\n\\nB. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nTHIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ITUNES SARL. (\"ITUNES\") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “SERVICE”).\\n\\nTHE ITUNES STORE SERVICE\\n\\niTunes is the provider of the Service, which permits you to access, purchase or rent a licence for digital content (\"iTunes Products\") for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iTunes is not the provider of the iTunes application or of the iPad, iPod or iPhone.\\n\\nREQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE\\n\\nOnly persons aged 13 years or older can create accounts. Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. Children under the age of 18 should review this Agreement with their parent or legal guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it.\\n\\nThe Service is available to you only in the United Kingdom. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside this location. iTunes may use technologies to verify your compliance.\\n\\nUse of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for Film Rentals. The latest version of the iTunes software is recommended to access the Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased or acquired from the Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.\\n\\nYOUR ACCOUNT\\n\\nAs a registered user of the Service, you may establish an account (\"Account\"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify iTunes of any security breach of your Account. iTunes shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account.\\n\\nIn order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.\\n\\nYou agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the Service (\"Registration Data\"), and you agree to update your Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that iTunes may store and use the Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.\\n\\nAUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES\\n\\nWhen you first acquire music, purchased (i.e. not rented) movie, TV show and music video iTunes Products (collectively, “iTunes Eligible Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such iTunes Eligible Content on additional compatible iOS Devices (except for purchased movies and TV show iTunes Products) and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”). For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of iTunes Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the iTunes Eligible Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, iTunes Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.\\n\\nAs an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring iTunes Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some iTunes Eligible Content that you previously acquired may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and iTunes shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content, once you download an item of iTunes Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.\\n\\nAssociation of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:\\n\\n(i) You may auto-download iTunes Eligible Content or download previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.\\n\\n(ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.\\n\\n(iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.\\n\\n(iv) You may download previously-acquired free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the iTunes Service, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.\\n\\nAn Apple TV is not an “Associated Device.” However, TV show iTunes Products and purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products may be played back on compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only play back any such TV show or movie on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.\\n\\nSome pieces of iTunes Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such iTunes Eligible Content over a data connection.\\n\\nITUNES MATCH\\n\\niTunes Match permits you to remotely access your matched or uploaded songs, and music videos you have purchased with your Account, along with related metadata, playlists, and other information about your iTunes Library (“iTunes Match Content”).\\n\\nYou may subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee. You must have a valid credit card on file with iTunes to subscribe. The subscription is non-refundable (except as required by applicable law or as set out in our refund policy above), and will automatically renew for one-year periods until you cancel. Your account will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal by adjusting the iTunes Store account settings on your computer. You will no longer be able to access your iTunes Match Content from iTunes Match after the end of your subscription period.\\n\\niTunes Match works with libraries that contain up to 25,000 songs which are either (i) not currently available on the iTunes Service, or (ii) not purchased from the iTunes Service with your Account. Songs that do not meet certain criteria, or that are not authorized for your computer are not eligible for iTunes Match.\\n\\niTunes Match will automatically scan the song files and collect other information that may be used to identify media in your iTunes library, such as the names of songs, song artists or song durations. iTunes Match will use this information to match songs to those currently available on the iTunes Store, and will make matched songs available to you in a format then available on the iTunes Store. If the song is not successfully matched, your copy of the song will be uploaded to iTunes in the same format or a format determined by iTunes. iTunes reserves the right to limit types of content uploaded (for example, excessively large files). Matched or uploaded songs and related metadata will be available for access from an Associated Device that has been enabled for iTunes Match. Association of Associated Devices for iTunes Match is subject to the same terms as Automatic Delivery and Downloading Previous Purchases, and uploaded or matched songs and related information are deemed to be “iTunes Eligible Content.” You may also access iTunes Match Content from compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only do so on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.\\n\\nWhen you use iTunes Match, Genius will begin associating information about the media in your iTunes library with your Account; the association with your Account will continue for a period of time after your subscription ends. iTunes will otherwise use this information as described in the Privacy Section of this Agreement. You will not be able to disable Genius while using iTunes Match, so if you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not use iTunes Match.\\n\\nYou hereby agree to use iTunes Match only for lawfully acquired content. Any use for illegitimate content infringes the rights of others and may subject you to civil and criminal penalties, including possible monetary damages, for copyright infringement.\\n\\niTunes Match is provided on an “AS IS” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information, including music, playlist, and play history, from your computer or device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and other computers) connected thereto. You should back up all data and information on your computer or device and any peripherals prior to using iTunes Match. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of iTunes Match is at your sole risk. To the extent permitted by law, iTunes shall have no liability with respect to your use of iTunes Match, including the inability to access matched or uploaded content.\\n\\nPRIVACY\\n\\nThe Service is subject to Apple\\'s Privacy Policy at http://www.apple.com/uk/privacy/.\\n\\nWhen you opt in to the Genius feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information that can be used to identify media in your iTunes library on any Genius-enabled device, such as your play history and playlists. This includes media purchased or acquired through iTunes and media obtained from other sources. This information will be stored anonymously and will not be associated with your name or Account. When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you.\\n\\nApple may only use this information and combine it with aggregated information from the iTunes libraries of other users who also opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, aggregated purchase history data from other iTunes Store users, and other information obtained from third parties, to:\\n\\n• Create personalized playlists for you from your iTunes library.\\n\\n• Provide you with recommendations regarding media and other products and services that you may wish to purchase or acquire.\\n\\n• Provide recommendations regarding products and services to other users.\\n\\nAt all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.\\n\\nOnce you opt in to the Genius feature, you will be able to create Genius playlists on Genius-capable devices.\\n\\nIf you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer or turning off Genius in the Settings on your device. After you opt out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple devices, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each device.\\n\\nBy opting in to the Genius feature, you consent to the use of your information as described above and as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy.\\n\\nCONTENT AVAILABILITY\\n\\niTunes reserves the right to change content options (including eligibility for particular features) without notice.\\n\\nUSE OF CONTENT\\n\\nYou agree that the iTunes Products are provided to you by way of a license only. You understand that the Service and certain iTunes Products include a security framework using technology that protects digital information and limits your use of iTunes Products to certain usage rules (“Security Framework”) established by iTunes and its licensors and that, whether or not iTunes Products are limited by security technology, you shall use iTunes Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by iTunes and its licensors (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the iTunes Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the iTunes Products. iTunes reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules for future purchases on the Service at any time. However, such changes will not apply to iTunes Products that you have already purchased. Any change to the Usage Rules will be communicated to you. In the event that you refuse to accept the new Usage Rules, you will no longer be able to acquire iTunes Products from the Service.\\n\\nUSAGE RULES\\n\\n(i) You shall be authorised to use iTunes Products only for personal, noncommercial use. For details of your rights and restrictions on your rights to use the iTunes Products, see:\\n\\n• http://www.prsformusic.com\\n\\n• http://www.warnerchappell.com/wcmuk/pedl.jsp\\n\\n• http://www.sacem.fr\\n\\n• http://www.sdrm.fr\\n\\n• http://www.sesam.org\\n\\n(ii) You shall be authorised to use iTunes Products on five computers with the iTunes application installed at any time, except for Film Rentals (see below).\\n\\n(iii) You shall be able to store iTunes Products from up to five different Accounts at a time on compatible devices, such as an iPad, iPod, iPhone and Apple TV, provided that each iPhone may sync tone iTunes Products with only a single iTunes-authorised device at a time, and syncing an iPhone with a different iTunes-authorised device will cause tone iTunes Products stored on that iPhone to be erased.\\n\\n(iv) You shall be authorised to burn an audio playlist up to seven times. You may use the audio CD to which you have burned your iTunes Products in the same ways in which you may use an audio CD purchased from a retail store, subject to United Kingdom copyright laws.\\n\\n(v) You shall not be entitled to burn video iTunes Products or tone iTunes Products other than for backup purposes, which video iTunes Product backups will play via the iTunes application.\\n\\n(vi) iTunes Plus Products do not contain security technology that limits your usage of such iTunes Products, and Usage Rules (ii) – (v) do not apply to iTunes Plus Products. You may copy, store, and burn iTunes Plus Products as reasonably necessary for personal, noncommercial use.\\n\\n(vii) You shall be able to manually sync a film from at least one iTunes-authorised device to devices that have manual sync mode, provided that the film is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device, where the primary iTunes-authorised device is the one that was first synced with the device or the one that you subsequently designate as primary using the iTunes application.\\n\\n(viii) An HDCP connection is required to view films and TV shows transmitted over HDMI.\\n\\n(ix) Film Rentals\\n\\n(a) Film rentals are viewable on only one device at a time.

Children under the age of 18 should review this Agreement with their parent or legal guardian to ensure that the child and the parent or legal guardian understand it.\\n\\nThe Stores are available to you only in the United Kingdom. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Stores from outside this location. iTunes may use technologies to verify your compliance.\\n\\nUse of the Stores requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended. The latest versions of required software (including, but not limited to, iTunes and Mac App Store software) are recommended to access the Stores and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download Products previously purchased or acquired from the Stores. You agree that these requirements, which may change from time to time, are your responsibility. The Stores are not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Stores.\\n\\nYOUR ACCOUNT\\n\\nAs a registered user of the Stores, you may establish an account (\"Account\"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account, and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify iTunes of any security breach of your Account. iTunes shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account.\\n\\nIn order to purchase and download App Store Products from the Stores, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes; you can choose to allow your computer to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download App Store Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make App Store Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every App and Book Product transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer or iOS Device.

For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the Products will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, including those running on the Windows operating system, Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.\\n\\nAs an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously acquired Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some Eligible Content that you previously acquired may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and iTunes shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously acquired Eligible Content, once you download an item of Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.\\n\\nAssociation of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:\\n\\n(i) You may auto-download Eligible Content or download previously acquired Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorised computers.\\n\\n(ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.\\n\\n(iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only one every 90 days.\\n\\n(iv) You may download previously acquired free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the Stores, but no more than 5 iTunes-authorised computers.\\n\\nThe above terms (i) to (iv) do not apply to App Store Products.\\n\\nSome pieces of Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such Eligible Content over a data connection.\\n\\nAUTOMATIC DELIVERY OF UPDATES\\n\\nYour device or computer will periodically check with the App Store and Mac App Store for updates to the apps on your device or computer and, if available, the update may automatically download and install.

The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or Third-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store Application or App Store application.\\n\\nYour license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such terms will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the publisher of that App Store Product (the “Publisher”), in which case the Publisher’s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. The Publisher reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not expressly granted to you.\\n\\nYou acknowledge that the license to each Apple Product that you obtain through the Mac App Store or App Store, or you associate with your Account, is a binding agreement between you and iTunes. You acknowledge that: once you acquire a Third-Party Product from iTunes, you are entering into a binding agreement directly with the Publisher of that Third-Party Product governing your use of that Third-Party Product; and iTunes is not a party to the license between you and the Publisher with respect to that Third-Party Product.

In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is acquired and received by you, iTunes shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In-App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases received within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.\\n\\nYou must authenticate to acquire In-App Purchases separately from any authentication to obtain App Store Products by entering your password when prompted, but once you have authenticated to obtain an In-App Purchase, you will be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to acquire In-App Purchases on your iOS Device by going to your Settings, selecting “General” and then selecting the “Restrictions” tab, as outlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.\\n\\nIN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS\\n\\nCertain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to acquire content on a subscription basis (“In-App Subscriptions”). In-App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time period you have selected and, where applicable, your Account will be charged no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In-App Subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In-App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will be turned off if the Publisher increases the price of the subscription. You may cancel free In-App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product from your device. Certain paid In-App Subscriptions may offer a free trial period prior to charging your Account. If you decide you do not want to purchase the In App Subscription, turn off auto-renewal in your Account settings during the free trial period. Certain In-App Subscriptions may be designated as “Newsstand” products, in which case they will appear only within the Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also review additional information about the paid In-App Subscription offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for your permission to provide the name, email address and postcode listed in your Account to the Publisher so that the Publisher can send you marketing messages about its own products in accordance with its privacy policy. Once the Publisher has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Publisher\\'s publicly posted privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of the Publisher before agreeing to give it your personal information. For more information, please review the Publisher\\'s privacy policy or contact the Publisher directly. Refunds are available as set out in our refund policy above; no other refunds, returns or cancellations after purchase.\\n\\nPOPULAR NEAR ME\\n\\nWhen you opt in to Popular Near Me via enabling Location Services, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information related to certain of your App Store Products, such as your time spent with each App Store Product and the number of times each App Store Product is launched. This information is stored anonymously and will not be associated with your name or Account.

Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n(i) Except as set out in section (ii) hereunder, in no case shall Licensor, its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, principals or licensors be liable for any loss or damage caused by Licensor, its employees or agents where:\\n\\n(1) there is no breach of a legal duty of care owed to you by Licensor or by any of its employees or agents;\\n\\n(2) it is not a reasonably foreseeable result of any such breach;\\n\\n(3) any increase in loss or damage results from breach by you of any term of this End User Licence Agreement (\"Agreement\");\\n\\n(4) it results from a decision by Licensor to warn you, to suspend or terminate your access to the External Services, or to take any other action during the investigation of a suspected violation or as a result of Licensor’s conclusion that a violation of this Agreement has occurred;\\n\\n(5) it relates to loss of income, business or profits, or any loss or corruption of data in connection with your use of the Licensed Application.\\n\\n(ii) Nothing in this Agreement removes or limits Licensor’s liability for fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or for death or personal injury caused by its negligence.\\n\\ng.

If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by iTunes.\\n\\n1-Click®\\n\\n1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Stores with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the Stores on your computer, 1-Click purchasing may be activated via the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account information). When accessing the Stores on your Apple-branded products running iOS such as an iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone (“iOS Device”), 1-Click is activated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes your transaction without any further steps.\\n\\nGIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS AND CODES, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES\\n\\nGift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances, in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and, cannot be returned for a cash refund (except as set out in our refund policy above that is applicable in the event the item has been purchased from the iTunes Store; or except if the retailer from which the item has been purchased applies a different refund policy), without prejudice to any applicable statutory right to a refund in case of faulty or misdescribed gifts; exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts, Gift Certificates, or iTunes Cards or Codes; used to provide Allowances; used for purchases on the Apple Online Store; or used in Apple Retail Stores.

Risk of loss and title for Content Codes that are transmitted electronically pass from iTunes in Luxembourg upon electronic transmission.\\n\\niTunes reserves the right to close accounts and request alternative forms of payment if a Gift Certificate, iTunes Card and Codes, Content Code, or Allowance is fraudulently obtained or used on the Stores.\\n\\nGIFTS\\n\\nGifts purchased from the Stores may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, persons in the United Kingdom. Gift recipients must have compatible hardware and parental control settings to utilize some gifts.\\n\\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\\n\\nTo avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during your use of the products offered through the Stores, you should always take frequent breaks, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including but not limited to while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before using the products offered through the Stores if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop using such products immediately and see a doctor if they occur during your use of such products. Parents should monitor their children’s use of the products offered through the Stores for signs of symptoms.\\n\\nPRE-ORDERS\\n\\nBy pre-ordering products, you are authorizing the Stores to automatically charge your account and, if you have enabled automatic downloads, download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order anytime prior to the time the item becomes available and as set out in our refund policy above.\\n\\nFAMILY SHARING\\n\\nFamily Sharing allows you to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products with up to six members (including yourself) of a “Family.” If you set up or join a Family, you may view the eligible products of other Family members and download such products to your compatible device or computer. You can also choose to hide purchases so that other Family members will not be able to view or download them from you. You can share information such as photos and videos via the Photo app, events via your Family Calendar, reminders via the Reminders app, location information via Find My Friends, and device location via Find My iPhone. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only. iTunes and iCloud accounts are required; iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family. Certain transactions and features may not be compatible with earlier software and may require a software upgrade. If you join a Family, the features of Family Sharing are enabled on your compatible devices and computers automatically.\\n\\nThe “Organiser” of a Family can invite other members to participate in the Family. The Organiser must be 18 years or older and must have an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13. The Organiser\\'s payment method is used to pay for any purchase initiated by a Family member in excess of any store credit in such initiating Family member’s account. Family members are acting as agents for the Organiser when the Organiser\\'s payment method is used. Products are associated with the account of the Family member who initiated the transaction. BY INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO JOIN A FAMILY, THE ORGANISER AGREES THAT ALL CHARGES FOR PURCHASES INITIATED BY FAMILY MEMBERS ARE AUTHORISED BY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ORGANISER, EVEN IF THE ORGANISER WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR TRANSACTION, IF A FAMILY MEMBER EXCEEDED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY AS GRANTED BY THE ORGANISER, OR IF MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS INITIATE PURCHASES FOR THE SAME PRODUCT. THE ORGANISER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY AGREEMENT WITH ITS PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER, AND ASSUMES ALL RISK IN THE EVENT THAT SHARING ACCESS TO SUCH PAYMENT METHOD LIMITS ANY PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER. The Organiser can change the payment method on file at any time. A record of the purchase will be sent to the initiating Family member and the Organiser, even if the purchase is hidden by the Family member; please use Report a Problem on your receipt if you or your Family members do not recognise charges on your receipt or payment method statement.\\n\\nThe Organiser can use the Ask to Buy function to require children under the age of 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser, and/or other adults designated by the Organiser, to download free or paid products before a purchase or download commences. Products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. If you are an Organiser, you represent that you and/or any adult designee is the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite; product purchase or download requests from earlier software may present users with an alternative permission process or prevent purchases altogether, and may require a software upgrade. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from a delay in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.\\n\\nThe Organiser may remove any Family member from the Family, which will terminate that Family member\\'s ability to initiate authorised purchases on the Organiser\\'s payment method, and that Family Member’s ability to view and share other Family members\\' products and information. When a Family member leaves or is removed from a Family, or the Organiser\\'s Apple ID is terminated for any reason, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to view or download the departing member’s products or information, or access products previously downloaded from the departing Family member, including purchases made on the Organiser\\'s payment method while the departing member was part of the Family. Similarly, if you leave a Family, you may no longer be able to view or download the products or information of the other Family members, and products that you downloaded from other Family members while a member of the Family may no longer be accessible. If you have made In-App Purchases from an app originally purchased by a departed Family member or downloaded from a Family member and you no longer belong to the Family, you need to purchase the app yourself and restore the In-App Purchases to regain access to them; please review the developer’s policies and the section of this Agreement entitled “In-App Purchases” before buying In-App Purchases. Because personal accounts for users under age 13 can only be created as part of Family Sharing, deleting such an account in order to remove it from the Family will terminate that Family member’s Apple ID and his or her ability to access any Apple services that require an Apple ID or any content associated with that Apple ID.\\n\\nYou can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the store account you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must use the same iTunes Store country or region. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded from the iTunes Store on up to 10 devices per account, only five of which can be computers; eligible apps can be downloaded to any devices the Family member owns or controls. Not all products, including In-App Purchases, content that is not available for re-download, subscriptions, and some previously purchased apps, are eligible for Family Sharing. Apple reserves the right to disband a Family in accordance with the “Termination” section of this Agreement.\\n\\nELECTRONIC CONTRACTING\\n\\nYour use of the Stores includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. You acknowledge that your electronic submissions constitute your agreement and intent to be bound by and to pay for such agreements and transactions. Your agreement and intent to be bound by electronic submissions applies to all records relating to all transactions you enter into on this site, including notices of cancellation, policies, contracts and applications. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.\\n\\niTunes is not responsible for typographic errors.\\n\\nB. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\\n\\nTHIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND ITUNES SARL. (\"ITUNES\") GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “SERVICE”).\\n\\nTHE ITUNES STORE SERVICE\\n\\niTunes is the provider of the Service, which permits you to access, purchase or rent a licence for digital content (\"iTunes Products\") for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. iTunes is not the provider of the iTunes application or of the iPad, iPod or iPhone.\\n\\nREQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE SERVICE\\n\\nOnly persons aged 13 years or older can create accounts. Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. Children under the age of 18 should review this Agreement with their parent or legal guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it.\\n\\nThe Service is available to you only in the United Kingdom. You agree not to use or attempt to use the Service from outside this location. iTunes may use technologies to verify your compliance.\\n\\nUse of the Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for Film Rentals. The latest version of the iTunes software is recommended to access the Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased or acquired from the Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the Service.\\n\\nYOUR ACCOUNT\\n\\nAs a registered user of the Service, you may establish an account (\"Account\"). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify iTunes of any security breach of your Account. iTunes shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorised use of your Account.\\n\\nIn order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.\\n\\nYou agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the Service (\"Registration Data\"), and you agree to update your Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that iTunes may store and use the Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.', metadata={'source': 'data/reduced/Jan 2015_reduced.docx'})]"

       "[Document(page_content='Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions\\n\\nThese terms and conditions create a contract between you and Apple (the “Agreement”). Please read the Agreement carefully.\\n\\nA. INTRODUCTION TO OUR SERVICES\\n\\nThis Agreement governs your use of Apple’s Services (“Services” – e.g., and where available, App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, iTunes), through which you can buy, get, license, rent or subscribe to content, Apps (as defined below), and other in-app services (collectively, “Content”). Content may be offered through the Services by Apple or a third party. Our Services are available for your use in your country or territory of residence (“Home Country”). By creating an account for use of the Services in a particular country or territory you are specifying it as your Home Country. To use our Services, you need compatible hardware, software (latest version recommended and sometimes required) and Internet access (fees may apply). Our Services’ performance may be affected by these factors.\\n\\nB. USING OUR SERVICES\\n\\nPAYMENTS, TAXES AND REFUNDS\\n\\nYou can acquire Content on our Services for free or for a charge, either of which is referred to as a “Transaction”. By each Transaction, you acquire a license to use the Content only. Each Transaction is an electronic contract between you and Apple and/or you and the entity providing the Content on our Services. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for some Content you acquire from Apple Books, Apple Podcasts, or App Store as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Service. In such case, you acquire the Content from Apple Distribution International Ltd., which is licensed by the Content provider (e.g., App Provider (as defined below), book publisher, etc.). When you make your first Transaction, we will ask you to choose how frequently we should ask for your password for future Transactions. On applicable Apple hardware, if you enable Touch ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions with your fingerprint, and if you enable Face ID for Transactions, we will ask you to authenticate all Transactions using facial recognition. Manage your password settings at any time by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT204030.\\n\\nApple will charge your selected payment method for any paid Transactions, including any applicable taxes. If you have also added it to your Apple Wallet, Apple may charge your selected payment method in Apple Wallet using Apple Pay. You can associate multiple payment methods with your Apple ID, and you agree that Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions. Your primary payment method appears at the top of your account settings payments page.\\n\\nIf your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), you authorize Apple to attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order from top to bottom as they appear on your account settings payments page. If we cannot charge you , you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we may attempt to charge you again or request that you provide another payment method. If you pre-order Content, you will be charged when the Content is delivered to you (unless you cancel prior to the Content’s availability). In accordance with local law, Apple may automatically update your payment information regarding your payment methods, if provided such information by the payment networks or your financial institutions. Terms related to store credit and gift cards/codes are available here: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/giftcards/. For more details about how Transactions are billed, please visit https://support.apple.com/HT201359. You agree to receipt of all invoices in an electronic format, which may include email. Content prices may change at any time. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of Content, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement of the Content or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple. From time to time, Apple may suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if we find evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful or other manipulative behavior that entitles Apple to a corresponding counterclaim.\\n\\nRight of cancellation: If you choose to cancel your order, you may do so within 14 days of when you received your receipt, without giving any reason.\\n\\nTo cancel your order, you must inform us of your decision. To ensure immediate processing we recommend you use Report a Problem to cancel all items with the exception of Complete My Season, which can be cancelled by contacting iTunes Support. Subscription services can only be cancelled following the initial subscription and not upon each automatic renewal. You also have the right to inform us using the model cancellation form below or by making any other clear statement. If you use Report a Problem we will communicate acknowledgement of receipt of your cancellation to you without delay.\\n\\nTo meet the cancellation deadline, you must send your communication of cancellation before the 14-day period has expired.\\n\\nEffects of cancellation: We will reimburse you no later than 14 days from the day on which we receive your cancellation notice. We will use the same means of payment as you used for the Transaction, and you will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.\\n\\nException to the right of cancellation: You cannot cancel your order for the supply of Content if the delivery has started upon your request and acknowledgement that you thereby lose your cancellation right.\\n\\nModel cancellation form:\\n\\n- To Apple Distribution International Ltd., iTunes Store Customer Support, Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Hollyhill, Cork, Republic of Ireland, rightofwithdrawal@apple.com:\\n\\n- I hereby give notice that I withdraw from my contract for the following:\\n\\n[INSERT ORDER ID, ITEM, ARTIST AND TYPE]\\n\\n- Ordered on [INSERT DATE] / received on [INSERT DATE]\\n\\n- Name of consumer\\n\\n- Address of consumer\\n\\n- Email address of consumer\\n\\n- Date\\n\\nACCOUNT\\n\\nUsing our Services and accessing your Content may require an Apple ID. An Apple ID is the account you use across Apple’s ecosystem. Use of Game Center is subject to this Agreement and also requires a Game Center account. Your account is valuable, and you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality and security. Apple is not responsible for any losses arising from the unauthorized use of your account. Please contact Apple if you suspect that your account has been compromised.\\n\\nYou must be age 13 (or equivalent minimum age in your Home Country, as set forth in the Apple ID creation process) to create an account and use our Services. Apple IDs for persons under this age can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution. A parent or legal guardian who is creating an account for a minor should review this Agreement with the minor to ensure that they both understand it.\\n\\nYou may add, notify, or remove a Legacy Contact for your Apple ID as described in http://support.apple.com/HT212360. A Legacy Contact’s access to your Apple ID is limited as described in http://support.apple.com/HT212361.\\n\\nPRIVACY\\n\\nYour use of our Services is subject to Apple’s Privacy Policy, which is available at https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/.\\n\\nSERVICES AND CONTENT USAGE RULES\\n\\nYour use of the Services and Content must follow the rules set forth in this section (“Usage Rules”). Any other use of the Services and Content is a material breach of this Agreement. Apple may monitor your use of the Services and Content to ensure that you are following these Usage Rules.\\n\\nAll Services:\\n\\n- You may use the Services and Content only for personal, noncommercial purposes (except as set forth in the App Store Content section below or as otherwise specified by Apple).\\n\\n- Apple’s delivery of Services or Content does not transfer any commercial or promotional use rights to you, and does not constitute a grant or waiver of any rights of the copyright owners.\\n\\n- You can use Content from up to five different Apple IDs on each device.\\n\\n- For any Service, you can have up to 10 devices (but only a maximum of 5 computers) signed in with your Apple ID at one time, though simultaneous streams or downloads of Content may be limited to a lower number of devices as set out below under Apple Music and Apple TV content. Each computer must also be authorized using the same Apple ID (to learn more about authorization of computers, visit https://support.apple.com/HT201251). Devices can be associated with a different Apple ID once every 90 days.\\n\\n- Manipulating play counts, downloads, ratings, or reviews via any means — such as (i) using a bot, script, or automated process; or (ii) providing or accepting any kind of compensation or incentive — is prohibited.\\n\\n- It is your responsibility not to lose, destroy or damage Content once downloaded. We encourage you to back up your Content regularly.\\n\\n- You may not tamper with or circumvent any security technology included with the Services or Content.\\n\\n- You may access our Services only using Apple’s software, and may not modify or use modified versions of such software.\\n\\n- Video Content requires an HDCP connection.\\n\\nAudio and Video Content Sales and Rentals:\\n\\n- You can use Digital Rights Management (DRM)-free Content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that you own or control. DRM-protected Content can be used on up to five computers and any number of devices that you sync to from those computers.\\n\\n- Content rentals are viewable on a single device at a time, and must be played within 30 days, and completed within 48 hours of the start of play (stopping, pausing or restarting does not extend this period).\\n\\n- You may burn an audio playlist of purchased music to disc for listening purposes up to seven times; this limitation does not apply to DRM-free Content. Other Content may not be burned to disc. You may use the disc to which you have burned your Content in the same ways in which you may use a disc purchased from a retail store, subject to local copyright laws.\\n\\n- Purchased Content will generally remain available for you to download, redownload, or otherwise access from Apple. Though it is unlikely, subsequent to your purchase, Content may be removed from the Services (for instance, because the provider removed it) and become unavailable for further download or access from Apple. To ensure your ability to continue enjoying Content, we encourage you to download all purchased Content to a device in your possession and to back it up.\\n\\nApp Store Content:\\n\\n- The term “Apps” includes apps and App Clips for any Apple platform and/or operating system, including any in-app purchases, extensions (such as keyboards), stickers, and subscriptions made available in such apps or App Clips.\\n\\n- Individuals acting on behalf of a commercial enterprise, governmental organization or educational institution (an “Enterprise”) may download and sync non-Arcade Apps for use by either (i) a single individual on one or more devices owned or controlled by an Enterprise; or (ii) multiple individuals on a single shared device owned or controlled by an Enterprise. For the sake of clarity, each device used serially or collectively by multiple users requires a separate license.\\n\\nApple Music:\\n\\n- An Individual Apple Music membership allows you to stream on a single device at a time; a Family membership allows you or your Family members to stream on up to six devices at a time.\\n\\nApple Arcade:\\n\\n- Apple Arcade Apps may only be downloaded, or redownloaded, with a valid Apple Arcade trial or subscription.\\n\\n- If your subscription ends, Apps downloaded via Apple Arcade will no longer be accessible to you.\\n\\nApple TV Content:\\n\\n- For most channels, you can stream video Content on up to three devices simultaneously.\\n\\n- Learn more about Apple TV Content Usage Rules at https://support.apple.com/HT210074.\\n\\nDOWNLOADS\\n\\nYou may be limited in the amount of Content you may download, and some downloaded Content may expire after a given amount of time after downloaded or first played. Certain Content may not be available for download at all.\\n\\nYou may be able to redownload previously acquired Content (“Redownload”) to your devices that are signed in with the same Apple ID (“Associated Devices”). You can see Content types available for Redownload in your Home Country at https://support.apple.com/HT204632. Content may not be available for Redownload if that Content is no longer offered on our Services.\\n\\nContent also may be removed from our Services at any time (for instance, because the provider removed it), after which it cannot be downloaded, redownloaded, or otherwise accessed from Apple.\\n\\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\\n\\nThe Services and certain Apps may allow you to purchase access to Content or Services on a subscription basis (“Paid Subscriptions”). Paid Subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled in the Manage Subscriptions section of your account settings. To learn more about cancelling your subscriptions, visit https://support.apple.com/HT202039. You will be notified if the price of a Paid Subscription increases and, if required, your consent will be required to continue. You will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest Paid Subscription period. If we cannot charge your payment method for any reason (such as expiration or insufficient funds), and you have not cancelled the Paid Subscription, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts, and we will attempt to charge the payment method as you may update your payment method information. This may result in a change to the start of your next Paid Subscription period and may change the date on which you are billed for each period, as displayed on your receipt. We reserve the right to cancel your Paid Subscription if we are unable to successfully charge your payment method to renew your subscription. Certain Paid Subscriptions may offer a free trial prior to charging your payment method. If you decide to unsubscribe from a Paid Subscription before we start charging your payment method, cancel the subscription at least 24 hours before the free trial ends.\\n\\nIf you start a free trial to a Paid Subscription offered by Apple as Content provider (an “Apple Paid Subscription”) and cancel before it ends, you cannot reactivate the free trial.\\n\\nFree trials or free offers to Apple Paid Subscriptions, excluding iCloud, cannot be combined with any free trials or offers of Apple One. If you are in a free trial or free offer for any Apple Paid Subscriptions, and you subscribe to Apple One, your free trial(s) or offer(s) will not be paused even if you have access to such Apple Paid Subscription(s) through your Apple One subscription. You acknowledge that your free trial or free offer may expire while you are a Paid Subscriber to Apple One, and Apple shall have no obligation to reinstate, reimburse, or otherwise compensate you for any part of such expired free trial or free offer.\\n\\nWhen your Paid Subscription to any Service or Content ends, you will lose access to any functionality or Content of that Service that requires a Paid Subscription.\\n\\nCONTENT AND SERVICE AVAILABILITY\\n\\nTerms found in this Agreement that relate to Services, Content types, features or functionality not available in your Home Country are not applicable to you, unless and until they become available to you. To see the Content types available to you in your Home Country, go to the Services or visit https://support.apple.com/HT204411. Certain Services and Content available to you in your Home Country may not be available to you when traveling outside of your Home Country except if required by law.\\n\\nTHIRD-PARTY DEVICES AND EQUIPMENT\\n\\nYou may not be able to use all features of the Services when accessing them on a non-Apple-branded device. Additionally, certain Services may require, direct, or suggest you use third-party equipment in some circumstances and/or for certain activities; such use is subject to the terms and conditions of such equipment and should be made in accordance with the applicable manufacturer’s instructions. By using the Services, you agree that Apple may automatically download and install minor updates to its software on third-party equipment from time to time.\\n\\nC. YOUR SUBMISSIONS TO OUR SERVICES\\n\\nOur Services may allow you to submit or post materials such as comments, ratings and reviews, pictures, videos and podcasts (including associated metadata and artwork). Your use of such features must comply with the Submissions Guidelines below, which may be updated from time to time, and if we become aware of materials that violate our Submission Guidelines we will remove them. If you see materials that do not comply with the Submissions Guidelines, please use the Report a Concern feature. Except to the extent prohibited by law, you hereby grant Apple a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials you submit within the Services and related marketing as well as to use the materials you submit for Apple internal purposes. Apple may monitor and decide to remove or edit any submitted material.\\n\\nSubmissions Guidelines: You may not use the Services to:\\n\\n- post any materials that (i) you do not have permission, right or license to use, or (ii) infringe on the rights of any third party;\\n\\n- post objectionable, offensive, unlawful, deceptive, inaccurate, or harmful content;\\n\\n- post personal, private or confidential information belonging to others;\\n\\n- request personal information from a minor;\\n\\n- impersonate or misrepresent your affiliation with another person or entity;\\n\\n- post or transmit spam, including but not limited to unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, promotional materials or informational announcements;\\n\\n- post, modify, or remove a rating or review in exchange for any kind of compensation or incentive;\\n\\n- post a dishonest, abusive, harmful, misleading, or bad-faith rating or review, or a rating or review that is irrelevant to the Content being reviewed;\\n\\n- plan or engage in any illegal, fraudulent or manipulative activity.\\n\\nD. FAMILY SHARING\\n\\nThe organizer of a Family (“Organizer”) must be 18 years (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country) or older and the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country as set forth in the registration process). Apple devices are required for access to all of the Family Sharing features. Family Sharing allows eligible subscriptions to be shared among up to six members of a Family. To learn more about Family Sharing visit: https://support.apple.com/HT201060.\\n\\nPurchase Sharing: Family Sharing’s Purchase Sharing feature allows eligible Content to be shared among up to six members of a Family. The Organizer invites other members to participate, and agrees to pay for all Transactions initiated by Family members. The Organizer\\'s eligible payment methods are used to pay for any Transaction initiated by a Family member (except when the Family member’s account has store credit, which is always used first). Family members are acting as agents for the Organizer when the Organizer’s eligible payment methods are used. The Organizer hereby agrees (1) to pay for such Transactions; (2) that Transactions initiated by Family members are authorized; and (3) Transactions will be charged to eligible payment methods in the manner indicated in Section B above. Organizers are responsible for complying with their payment method contracts, and assume all risk related to sharing access to their eligible payment methods with Family members. A receipt or invoice for any Family member Transaction is sent to the initiating Family member and, if billed to the Organizer’s payment method, also to the Organizer.\\n\\nAsk to Buy: Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer to approve Transactions initiated by a Family member under age 18 (or the equivalent age of majority in your Home Country). Content shared by Family members or acquired via content codes generally is not subject to Ask to Buy; content codes facilitating access to subscriptions are subject to Ask to Buy. The Organizer must be the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is enabled by default for any Family member under the age of 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in their Home Country) and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. If Ask to Buy is turned off after the Family member turns 18 years old, it cannot be turned on anymore. Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.\\n\\nFamily Member changes: When a Family member leaves or is removed from the Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to access the former member’s Content, including Content acquired with the Organizer’s payment method.\\n\\nFamily Sharing Rules: You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the Apple ID you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must share the same Home Country. Not all Content, including In-App Purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired Apps, are eligible for Purchase Sharing. Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Apple One Family, Apple One Premier, Apple Music Family, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, and Apple Fitness+ subscriptions are automatically enabled for Family Sharing. Subscriptions shared by a Family may be subject to Content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.\\n\\nE. SERIES PASS AND MULTI-PASS\\n\\nA Pass allows you to purchase and receive television Content as it becomes available. A Series Pass applies to television Content that has a limited number of episodes per series; a Multi-Pass applies to television Content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Series Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the Transaction. Series Pass or Multi-Pass Content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a Content provider delivers to Apple fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Series Pass, we will credit to your Apple ID the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided to Apple.\\n\\nF. ADDITIONAL APP STORE TERMS (EXCLUDING APPLE ARCADE APPS)\\n\\nLICENSE OF APP STORE CONTENT\\n\\nApp licenses are provided to you by Apple or a third party developer (“App Provider”). Apple acts as an agent for App Providers in operating the App Store and is not a party to the sales contract or user agreement between you and the App Provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., the merchant of record is Apple Distribution International Ltd., which means that you acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App is licensed by the App Provider. An App licensed by Apple is an “Apple App”; an App licensed by an App Provider is a “Third Party App\". Any App that you acquire is governed by the Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”) set forth below, unless Apple or the App Provider provides an overriding custom license agreement (“Custom EULA”). The App Provider of any Third Party App is solely responsible for its content, warranties, and claims that you may have related to the Third Party App, subject to local law. You acknowledge and agree that Apple is a third-party beneficiary of the Standard EULA or Custom EULA applicable to each Third Party App and may therefore enforce such agreement. Certain Apps, such as stickers and iMessage apps, may not appear on the device springboard but can be accessed and used in the Messages app drawer.\\n\\nIN-APP PURCHASES\\n\\nApps may offer content, services or functionality for use within such Apps (“In-App Purchases”). In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App (for example, virtual gems) cannot be transferred among devices and can be downloaded only once. You must authenticate your account before making In-App Purchases – separate from any authentication to obtain other Content – by entering your password or using Touch ID or Face ID. You will be able to make additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-authenticating unless you have asked us to require a password for every purchase or have enabled Touch ID or Face ID. You can turn off the ability to make In-App Purchases by following these instructions: https://support.apple.com/HT201304.\\n\\nAPP MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT\\n\\nApple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps only, or as required under applicable law. App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps.\\n\\nAPP BUNDLES\\n\\nSome Apps may be sold together as a bundle (“App Bundle”). The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for Apps you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle.\\n\\nSEARCH RESULTS AND RANKINGS\\n\\nWhen determining how to order the Apps in search results, the main parameters considered are the metadata provided by App Providers, how customers have engaged with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps in the App Store. These main parameters deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.\\n\\nLICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT\\n\\nApps made available through the App Store are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App is subject to your prior acceptance of either this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), or a custom end user license agreement between you and the App Provider (“Custom EULA”), if one is provided. Your license to any Apple App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third Party App under this Standard EULA or Custom EULA is granted by the App Provider of that Third Party App. Any App that is subject to this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application”. The App Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.\\n\\na. Scope of License: Licensor grants to you a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products that you own or control and as permitted by the Usage Rules. The terms of this Standard EULA will govern any content, materials, or services accessible from or purchased within the Licensed Application, as well as upgrades provided by Licensor that replace or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a Custom EULA. Except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not transfer, redistribute or sublicense the Licensed Application except as expressly permitted in this Agreement and, if you sell your Apple Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Apple Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application).\\n\\nb. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.\\n\\nc. Termination: This Standard EULA is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this Standard EULA will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with any of its terms.\\n\\nd. External Services: The Licensed Application may enable access to Licensor’s and/or third-party services and websites (collectively and individually, \"External Services\"). You agree to use the External Services at your sole risk. Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of any third-party External Services, and shall not be liable for any such third-party External Services. Data displayed by any Licensed Application or External Service, including but not limited to financial, medical and location information, is for general informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by Licensor or its agents. You will not use the External Services in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Standard EULA or that infringes the intellectual property rights of Licensor or any third party. You agree not to use the External Services to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten or defame any person or entity, and that Licensor is not responsible for any such use. External Services may not be available in all languages or in your Home Country, and may not be appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use such External Services, you are solely responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, disable or impose access restrictions or limits on any External Services at any time without notice or liability to you.\\n\\ne. WARRANTY: Licensor will use reasonable care and skill with respect to the provision of the Licensed Application and any External Services performed or provided by the Licensed Application to you.

U.S. Government End Users.

Consistent with 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation are being licensed to U.S. Government end users (a) only as Commercial Items and (b) with only those rights as are granted to all other end users pursuant to the terms and conditions herein. Unpublished-rights reserved under the copyright laws of the United States.\\n\\ni. Except to the extent expressly provided in the following paragraph, this Agreement and the relationship between you and Apple shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding its conflicts of law provisions.

If (a) you are not a U.S. citizen; (b) you do not reside in the U.S.; (c) you are not accessing the Service from the U.S.; and (d) you are a citizen of one of the countries identified below, you hereby agree that any dispute or claim arising from this Agreement shall be governed by the applicable law set forth below, without regard to any conflict of law provisions, and you hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the state, province or country identified below whose law governs:\\n\\nIf you are a resident of any European Union country or the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway or Iceland, the governing law and forum shall be the laws and courts of your usual place of residence.\\n\\nSpecifically excluded from application to this Agreement is that law known as the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.\\n\\nG. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR CONTENT ACQUIRED FROM THIRD PARTIES\\n\\nSome Content available in Apple Books, App Store, and Apple Podcasts (including Apple Podcasts Subscriptions) are acquired by you from the third-party provider of such Content (as displayed on the product page and/or during the acquisition process for the relevant Content), not Apple. In such case, Apple acts as an agent for the Content provider in providing the Content to you, and therefore Apple is not a party to the Transaction between you and the Content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., Apple Distribution International Ltd. is the merchant of record for the Content you acquire, but such Content is licensed by the Content provider. The Content provider reserves the right to enforce the terms of use relating to such Content. The Content provider is solely responsible for such Content, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to such Content.\\n\\nH. ADDITIONAL APPLE MUSIC TERMS\\n\\niCloud Music Library is an Apple Music feature that allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists and music videos acquired from Apple Music, the iTunes Store or another source (“iCloud Music Library Content”) on your Apple Music-enabled devices. iCloud Music Library is turned on automatically when you set up your Apple Music membership. iCloud Music Library collects information about your iCloud Music Library Content. This information is associated with your Apple ID, and compared to iCloud Music Library Content currently available on Apple Music. iCloud Music Library Content that is not matched is uploaded to Apple’s iCloud Music Library servers (in a format determined by Apple). You can upload up to 100,000 songs. Songs acquired from the iTunes Store do not count against this limit. Songs that do not meet certain criteria (for example, excessively large files) or that are not authorized for your device are not eligible for iCloud Music Library. When you use iCloud Music Library, Apple logs information such as the tracks you play, stop or skip, the devices you use and the time and duration of playback. You agree to use iCloud Music Library only for lawfully acquired content. iCloud Music Library is provided on an “AS IS” basis and could contain errors or inaccuracies. You should back up your data and information prior to using iCloud Music Library. If you are not an Apple Music member, you may purchase an iTunes Match subscription, which uses iCloud Music Library. When your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library, including iCloud Music Library Content that is uploaded to iCloud Music Library servers.\\n\\nI. ADDITIONAL APPLE FITNESS+ TERMS\\n\\nApple Fitness+ is for entertainment and/or informational purposes only and is not intended to provide any medical advice. You should always seek the advice of an appropriately qualified healthcare professional regarding (a) the safety and advisability of any given activity, or (b) any specific medical condition or symptoms.\\n\\nJ. CARRIER MEMBERSHIP\\n\\nWhere available, you may be offered to purchase a Service membership from your wireless carrier (a “Carrier Membership”). If you purchase a Carrier Membership, your carrier is the merchant of record, which means that you acquire the Service license from your carrier, which will bill you for the cost of your Service membership, but the Service is licensed and provided by Apple. Your purchase relationship with the carrier is governed by the carrier’s terms and conditions, not this Agreement, and any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership must be directed to your carrier, not Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, you agree that your carrier may exchange your carrier account information, telephone number and subscription information with Apple, and that Apple may use this information to determine the status of your Carrier Membership.\\n\\nK.

       "'This passage provides information about various features and policies related to purchasing and using products from the Apple Stores. It begins by explaining the convenience of the 1-Click feature, which allows users to make purchases with a single click on their computer or by tapping a button on their Apple-branded devices. When 1-Click is activated, the purchase is immediately downloaded and completed without any further steps.\\n\\nThe passage also discusses the terms and conditions for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances. These items are not redeemable for cash, cannot be returned for a cash refund, and have restrictions on their use. They may only be redeemed in the United Kingdom and are not transferable. Additionally, iTunes is not responsible for lost or stolen gift certificates or codes.\\n\\nThe passage also includes important safety information, advising users to take breaks and rest if they experience any discomfort while using the products offered through the Stores. It warns that a small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns and recommends consulting a doctor if these symptoms occur.\\n\\nLastly, the passage mentions pre-orders and family sharing. By pre-ordering products, users authorize the Stores to automatically charge their account and download the product when it becomes available. Family sharing allows purchases to be shared among family members, but it is important for parents to monitor their children\\'s use of the products for any signs of symptoms mentioned earlier.\\nThe passage explains the concept of Family Sharing, which allows up to six members of a family to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products. Family members can view and download each other\\'s eligible products, but there is an option to hide purchases. In addition to sharing products, Family Sharing also allows for the sharing of information such as photos, videos, events, reminders, and device location. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only and requires iTunes and iCloud accounts, as well as iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite.\\n\\nThe passage also discusses the role of the \"Organiser\" in a Family. The Organiser is responsible for inviting other members to join the Family and must be 18 years or older with an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. The Organiser\\'s payment method is used to pay for any purchases made by Family members, even if the Organiser was unaware of the transaction or if multiple Family members initiate purchases for the same product. The Organiser can change the payment method at any time, but is responsible for compliance with any agreement with the payment method provider.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Organiser has the ability to use the Ask to Buy function, which requires children under 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser or other designated adults before downloading free or paid products. However, products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. The passage emphasizes that Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, and earlier software may present alternative permission processes or prevent purchases altogether. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from delays in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.\\nThis passage outlines the requirements and guidelines for using the iTunes Service. It states that in order to use the service, users must have compatible devices, internet access, and certain software. High-speed internet access is recommended, especially for film rentals. Users are responsible for meeting these requirements, which may change over time. The passage also emphasizes that the service is separate from any other product or offering, and purchasing other products does not guarantee access to the service.\\n\\nThe passage then discusses the importance of account security. Users are advised not to share their account information with anyone else and are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account. Any unauthorized use of the account should be immediately reported to iTunes. To purchase and download iTunes products, users must enter their Apple ID and password or use Touch ID for authentication. Once authenticated, users do not need to re-enter their password for fifteen minutes. However, users have the option to require a password for every transaction or turn off the ability to make transactions altogether.\\n\\nThe passage also mentions automatic delivery and downloading of previous purchases. Users can choose to automatically receive copies of purchased iTunes content on additional compatible devices. The content will auto-download on devices with push notifications, while on devices without push notifications, it will appear in the download queue for manual initiation. Users are also allowed to download previously-acquired content onto associated devices. However, there are limitations on the number of associated devices and iTunes-authorized computers. Free content can be downloaded onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free, but on no more than five iTunes-authorized computers.\\nThis passage provides information about the usage and limitations of Apple TV and iTunes Match. It states that Apple TV is not considered an \"Associated Device\" but can be used to play back TV shows and purchased movies from iTunes, with a limitation on the number of Apple TVs that can be used simultaneously. It also warns that some iTunes content may be large and result in significant data charges when delivered over a data connection.\\n\\nThe passage then explains iTunes Match, which allows users to remotely access their matched or uploaded songs, music videos, playlists, and other information about their iTunes Library. Users must subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee, which will automatically renew unless canceled. The service works with libraries containing up to 25,000 songs that are not currently available on iTunes or not purchased from iTunes. iTunes Match scans song files and collects information to match songs with those available on the iTunes Store. If a song is not successfully matched, the user\\'s copy will be uploaded to iTunes. iTunes Match content can be accessed from Associated Devices and compatible Apple TVs, with limitations on the number of devices that can be used simultaneously.\\n\\nThe passage also mentions that when using iTunes Match, Genius will associate information about the media in the user\\'s iTunes library with their Account. This association will continue for a period of time after the subscription ends. It states that iTunes Match should only be used for lawfully acquired content and warns against using illegitimate content, which may result in civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringement. The passage concludes by mentioning that iTunes Match is provided on an \"AS IS\" basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies, and that users should back up their data before using the service. It also refers to Apple\\'s Privacy Policy for information on privacy.\\nThis passage discusses the Genius feature offered by Apple. When users opt in to this feature, Apple collects information from their iTunes library, such as play history and playlists, in order to provide personalized recommendations. This information is stored anonymously and not associated with the user\\'s name or account. Apple may also combine this information with aggregated data from other users who have opted in, as well as purchase history data and information from third parties, to create personalized playlists and provide recommendations for media and other products and services.\\n\\nUsers have the option to enable or disable the Genius feature at any time. If they choose not to enable it, Apple will not collect or use information from their iTunes library in this manner. By opting in, users consent to the use of their information as described and in accordance with Apple\\'s Privacy Policy. The passage also mentions that iTunes reserves the right to change content options without notice and that the iTunes Products are provided to users through a license, with certain usage rules and restrictions.\\n\\nThe passage concludes by outlining the usage rules for iTunes Products. Users are authorized to use these products for personal, noncommercial use and can store them on up to five different devices. They can also burn an audio playlist up to seven times and use the burned CD in the same way as a retail store-bought CD, subject to copyright laws. However, burning video iTunes Products is only allowed for backup purposes and these backups can only be played via the iTunes application.\\nThis passage outlines the terms and conditions for using the iTunes Service. It states that users are able to submit materials and links to third-party content on the Service, but they are responsible for ensuring that these materials do not infringe on the rights of others or violate any laws. By submitting materials, users grant iTunes a license to use them as part of the Service without compensation. iTunes reserves the right to not post or publish any materials and to remove or edit any material at its discretion.\\n\\nThe passage also mentions that iTunes has the right to monitor materials submitted by users and to take action if there is a violation of the agreement. It provides links to third-party websites but states that iTunes is not responsible for the content or accuracy of these websites. Users are warned that they may encounter offensive or objectionable material while using the Service and that iTunes is not liable for this. The accuracy of product types and descriptions is not guaranteed.\\n\\nThe passage emphasizes that the Service and its content are protected by intellectual property laws and that users are not allowed to use this proprietary information or materials in any way except for using the Service in compliance with the agreement. Users are not permitted to modify, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service. iTunes reserves the right to change or remove any content or materials offered by the Service without notice. The copyright in the Service belongs to iTunes and its licensors, and unauthorized use may result in civil and criminal penalties.\\nThis passage is a section of the terms and conditions agreement for iTunes. It states that if a user breaches the agreement, they will be held liable for any claims arising from the breach and for any actions taken by iTunes during their investigation. iTunes also reserves the right to modify the agreement at any time and impose new terms or conditions, which will be effective immediately and incorporated into the agreement. If a user refuses to accept these changes, iTunes has the right to terminate the agreement.\\n\\nThe agreement also states that it governs the user\\'s use of the service and supersedes any prior agreements. The user may also be subject to additional terms and conditions when using affiliate services, certain iTunes products, third-party content, or third-party software. If any part of the agreement is held invalid, the remaining portions will still be in effect. iTunes is not responsible for failures to fulfill obligations due to causes beyond its control.\\n\\nThe service is operated by iTunes from its offices in Luxembourg, and the user agrees to comply with all applicable laws. iTunes may notify the user through email, postal mail, or a posting on the service. iTunes also has the right to take steps to enforce and verify compliance with the agreement, including disclosing registration data and account information to law enforcement authorities or third parties if necessary.\\n\\nThe passage also introduces the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store, stating that iTunes is the provider of these stores. Users can purchase licenses for software products and digital book content from these stores. The requirements for using the stores include being at least 13 years old, with accounts for those under 13 being created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. The stores are only available in the United Kingdom, and iTunes may use technologies to verify compliance with this restriction.\\nThis passage outlines several important aspects of using the App Store and Mac App Store. Firstly, it explains that your device or computer will periodically check for updates to the apps on your device, and if available, these updates may automatically download and install. However, you have the option to turn off automatic updates at any time. \\n\\nThe passage also mentions the concept of App Bundles, which are packages that contain multiple items. The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing it, and the price may be reduced if you have already purchased or acquired some of the items included in the bundle.\\n\\nPrivacy is addressed in the passage, stating that the Stores are subject to Apple\\'s Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy can be found on Apple\\'s website.\\n\\nThe passage also explains that when you purchase a product from iTunes, you are actually purchasing a license to use the product. This license forms a binding agreement between you and the publisher of the product. The usage of products is subject to certain rules established by iTunes and the publishers, and any other use may constitute copyright infringement. iTunes reserves the right to modify the usage rules for future purchases, but these changes will not apply to products you have already purchased.\\n\\nThe passage also emphasizes the importance of content security and store security. Users are not allowed to violate or tamper with the security framework of the products, and violations may result in enforcement actions by iTunes. Access to the stores should only be done through software provided by Apple, and unauthorized access may result in legal consequences.\\n\\nLastly, the passage mentions that the stores may offer interactive features for users to submit materials, but users are responsible for ensuring that their submissions do not infringe on the rights of others or violate any laws. iTunes has the right to remove or edit any materials submitted by users.\\nThis passage outlines the scope of the license granted to the user for the Licensed Application. The license allows the user to use the application on Apple-branded products running iOS or Mac OS X that they own or control, as long as it is in compliance with the Usage Rules set forth in the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store Terms and Conditions. The license does not permit the user to use the application on Apple devices that they do not own or control, and it prohibits the distribution or availability of the application over a network for multiple devices to use simultaneously. The user is also not allowed to rent, lease, sell, transfer, or sublicense the application, and if they sell their Apple device, they must remove the application from it.\\n\\nThe passage also includes a section on the user\\'s consent to the collection and use of data by the Licensor. The user agrees that the Licensor may collect technical data and related information about their device, system, and application software to facilitate software updates, product support, and other services related to the Licensed Application. The Licensor may use this information to improve its products or provide services, as long as it does not personally identify the user.\\n\\nThe passage further discusses the termination of the license, stating that it is effective until terminated by the user or the Licensor. If the user fails to comply with any terms of the license, their rights will automatically terminate without notice from the Licensor. In such cases, the user must cease all use of the Licensed Application and destroy all copies of it.\\n\\nLastly, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application may enable access to external services and websites. The use of these external services requires internet access and may require the user to accept additional terms. The user acknowledges that they may encounter offensive or objectionable content while using these services and that the Licensor and its agents are not liable for such content. The passage also states that the Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, legality, or quality of third-party materials or websites accessed through the Licensed Application. These materials and links are provided as a convenience to the user.\\nThis passage outlines the terms and conditions for using the Licensed Application and iBooks Store Products. It states that the Licensor has the right to warn, suspend, or terminate access to the External Services if there is a suspected violation of the agreement. It also mentions that the Licensor is not liable for any loss of income, business, or profits, or any loss or corruption of data resulting from the use of the Licensed Application. However, the Licensor\\'s liability is not limited in cases of fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or death or personal injury caused by negligence.\\n\\nThe passage also includes restrictions on the use and export of the Licensed Application. It states that the application can only be used and exported in accordance with United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained. It cannot be exported to U.S.-embargoed countries or to individuals on certain U.S. government lists. The user must also agree not to use the products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including the development of weapons.\\n\\nFurthermore, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application and related documentation are considered \"Commercial Items\" and are being licensed to U.S. Government end users with the same rights as other end users. The license and use of the Licensed Application are governed by English laws and may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.\\n\\nIn addition to the terms and conditions for the Licensed Application, the passage also includes information about the license and usage rules for iBooks Store Products. It states that the license for these products is between the user and the third-party publisher, not iTunes. The publisher is responsible for the product, its content, any warranties, and any claims related to its use. The passage also outlines the usage rules for iBooks Store Products, including limitations on personal, noncommercial use, the number of devices on which the products can be stored, and the restrictions on promotional use and burning the products to disc.\\nThis passage discusses the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from an iTunes-authorised device to other devices. It states that this can be done as long as the iBooks Store Product is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is defined as the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.\\n\\nIn simpler terms, this passage is saying that users have the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from one iTunes-authorised device to other devices. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met for this to happen. The iBooks Store Product must be associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is either the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.\\n\\nOverall, this passage is explaining the process of manually syncing iBooks Store Products and the requirements for doing so. It provides a clear definition of the primary iTunes-authorised device and emphasizes the importance of having the iBooks Store Product associated with an Account on this device.'"

The service works with libraries containing up to 25,000 songs that are not currently available on iTunes or not purchased from iTunes. iTunes Match scans song files and collects information to match songs with those available on the iTunes Store.

This association will continue for a period of time after the subscription ends. It states that iTunes Match should only be used for lawfully acquired content and warns against using illegitimate content, which may result in civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringement.

It states that if a user breaches the agreement, they will be held liable for any claims arising from the breach and for any actions taken by iTunes during their investigation. iTunes also reserves the right to modify the agreement at any time and impose new terms or conditions, which will be effective immediately and incorporated into the agreement. If a user refuses to accept these changes, iTunes has the right to terminate the agreement.\\n\\nThe agreement also states that it governs the user\\'s use of the service and supersedes any prior agreements. The user may also be subject to additional terms and conditions when using affiliate services, certain iTunes products, third-party content, or third-party software. If any part of the agreement is held invalid, the remaining portions will still be in effect. iTunes is not responsible for failures to fulfill obligations due to causes beyond its control.\\n\\nThe service is operated by iTunes from its offices in Luxembourg, and the user agrees to comply with all applicable laws. iTunes may notify the user through email, postal mail, or a posting on the service. iTunes also has the right to take steps to enforce and verify compliance with the agreement, including disclosing registration data and account information to law enforcement authorities or third parties if necessary.\\n\\nThe passage also introduces the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store, stating that iTunes is the provider of these stores. Users can purchase licenses for software products and digital book content from these stores.

The Privacy Policy can be found on Apple\\'s website.\\n\\nThe passage also explains that when you purchase a product from iTunes, you are actually purchasing a license to use the product. This license forms a binding agreement between you and the publisher of the product. The usage of products is subject to certain rules established by iTunes and the publishers, and any other use may constitute copyright infringement. iTunes reserves the right to modify the usage rules for future purchases, but these changes will not apply to products you have already purchased.\\n\\nThe passage also emphasizes the importance of content security and store security.

The license allows the user to use the application on Apple-branded products running iOS or Mac OS X that they own or control, as long as it is in compliance with the Usage Rules set forth in the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store Terms and Conditions. The license does not permit the user to use the application on Apple devices that they do not own or control, and it prohibits the distribution or availability of the application over a network for multiple devices to use simultaneously. The user is also not allowed to rent, lease, sell, transfer, or sublicense the application, and if they sell their Apple device, they must remove the application from it.\\n\\nThe passage also includes a section on the user\\'s consent to the collection and use of data by the Licensor. The user agrees that the Licensor may collect technical data and related information about their device, system, and application software to facilitate software updates, product support, and other services related to the Licensed Application. The Licensor may use this information to improve its products or provide services, as long as it does not personally identify the user.\\n\\nThe passage further discusses the termination of the license, stating that it is effective until terminated by the user or the Licensor. If the user fails to comply with any terms of the license, their rights will automatically terminate without notice from the Licensor. In such cases, the user must cease all use of the Licensed Application and destroy all copies of it.\\n\\nLastly, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application may enable access to external services and websites. The use of these external services requires internet access and may require the user to accept additional terms. The user acknowledges that they may encounter offensive or objectionable content while using these services and that the Licensor and its agents are not liable for such content. The passage also states that the Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, legality, or quality of third-party materials or websites accessed through the Licensed Application. These materials and links are provided as a convenience to the user.\\nThis passage outlines the terms and conditions for using the Licensed Application and iBooks Store Products.

However, the Licensor\\'s liability is not limited in cases of fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or death or personal injury caused by negligence.\\n\\nThe passage also includes restrictions on the use and export of the Licensed Application. It states that the application can only be used and exported in accordance with United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained. It cannot be exported to U.S.-embargoed countries or to individuals on certain U.S. government lists. The user must also agree not to use the products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including the development of weapons.\\n\\nFurthermore, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application and related documentation are considered \"Commercial Items\" and are being licensed to U.S. Government end users with the same rights as other end users. The license and use of the Licensed Application are governed by English laws and may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.\\n\\nIn addition to the terms and conditions for the Licensed Application, the passage also includes information about the license and usage rules for iBooks Store Products. It states that the license for these products is between the user and the third-party publisher, not iTunes. The publisher is responsible for the product, its content, any warranties, and any claims related to its use. The passage also outlines the usage rules for iBooks Store Products, including limitations on personal, noncommercial use, the number of devices on which the products can be stored, and the restrictions on promotional use and burning the products to disc.\\nThis passage discusses the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from an iTunes-authorised device to other devices. It states that this can be done as long as the iBooks Store Product is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is defined as the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.\\n\\nIn simpler terms, this passage is saying that users have the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from one iTunes-authorised device to other devices. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met for this to happen. The iBooks Store Product must be associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is either the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.\\n\\nOverall, this passage is explaining the process of manually syncing iBooks Store Products and the requirements for doing so. It provides a clear definition of the primary iTunes-authorised device and emphasizes the importance of having the iBooks Store Product associated with an Account on this device.')"

       "[\"This passage provides information about various features and policies related to purchasing and using products from the Apple Stores. It begins by explaining the convenience of the 1-Click feature, which allows users to make purchases with a single click on their computer or by tapping a button on their Apple-branded devices. When 1-Click is activated, the purchase is immediately downloaded and completed without any further steps.\\n\\nThe passage also discusses the terms and conditions for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances. These items are not redeemable for cash, cannot be returned for a cash refund, and have restrictions on their use. They may only be redeemed in the United Kingdom and are not transferable. Additionally, iTunes is not responsible for lost or stolen gift certificates or codes.\\n\\nThe passage also includes important safety information, advising users to take breaks and rest if they experience any discomfort while using the products offered through the Stores. It warns that a small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns and recommends consulting a doctor if these symptoms occur.\\n\\nLastly, the passage mentions pre-orders and family sharing. By pre-ordering products, users authorize the Stores to automatically charge their account and download the product when it becomes available. Family sharing allows purchases to be shared among family members, but it is important for parents to monitor their children's use of the products for any signs of symptoms mentioned earlier.\",\n",
       " 'The passage explains the concept of Family Sharing, which allows up to six members of a family to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products. Family members can view and download each other\\'s eligible products, but there is an option to hide purchases. In addition to sharing products, Family Sharing also allows for the sharing of information such as photos, videos, events, reminders, and device location. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only and requires iTunes and iCloud accounts, as well as iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite.\\n\\nThe passage also discusses the role of the \"Organiser\" in a Family. The Organiser is responsible for inviting other members to join the Family and must be 18 years or older with an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. The Organiser\\'s payment method is used to pay for any purchases made by Family members, even if the Organiser was unaware of the transaction or if multiple Family members initiate purchases for the same product. The Organiser can change the payment method at any time, but is responsible for compliance with any agreement with the payment method provider.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Organiser has the ability to use the Ask to Buy function, which requires children under 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser or other designated adults before downloading free or paid products. However, products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. The passage emphasizes that Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, and earlier software may present alternative permission processes or prevent purchases altogether. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from delays in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.',\n",
       " 'This passage outlines the requirements and guidelines for using the iTunes Service. It states that in order to use the service, users must have compatible devices, internet access, and certain software. High-speed internet access is recommended, especially for film rentals. Users are responsible for meeting these requirements, which may change over time. The passage also emphasizes that the service is separate from any other product or offering, and purchasing other products does not guarantee access to the service.\\n\\nThe passage then discusses the importance of account security. Users are advised not to share their account information with anyone else and are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account. Any unauthorized use of the account should be immediately reported to iTunes. To purchase and download iTunes products, users must enter their Apple ID and password or use Touch ID for authentication. Once authenticated, users do not need to re-enter their password for fifteen minutes.
