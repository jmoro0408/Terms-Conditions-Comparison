This passage provides information about various features and policies related to purchasing and using products from the Apple Stores. It begins by explaining the convenience of the 1-Click feature, which allows users to make purchases with a single click on their computer or by tapping a button on their Apple-branded devices. When 1-Click is activated, the purchase is immediately downloaded and completed without any further steps.

The passage also discusses the terms and conditions for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances. These items are not redeemable for cash, cannot be returned for a cash refund, and have restrictions on their use. They may only be redeemed in the United Kingdom and are not transferable. Additionally, iTunes is not responsible for lost or stolen gift certificates or codes.

The passage also includes important safety information, advising users to take breaks and rest if they experience any discomfort while using the products offered through the Stores. It warns that a small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns and recommends consulting a doctor if these symptoms occur.

Lastly, the passage mentions pre-orders and family sharing. By pre-ordering products, users authorize the Stores to automatically charge their account and download the product when it becomes available. Family sharing allows purchases to be shared among family members, but it is important for parents to monitor their children's use of the products for any signs of symptoms mentioned earlier.
The passage explains the concept of Family Sharing, which allows up to six members of a family to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products. Family members can view and download each other's eligible products, but there is an option to hide purchases. In addition to sharing products, Family Sharing also allows for the sharing of information such as photos, videos, events, reminders, and device location. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only and requires iTunes and iCloud accounts, as well as iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite.

The passage also discusses the role of the "Organiser" in a Family. The Organiser is responsible for inviting other members to join the Family and must be 18 years or older with an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. The Organiser's payment method is used to pay for any purchases made by Family members, even if the Organiser was unaware of the transaction or if multiple Family members initiate purchases for the same product. The Organiser can change the payment method at any time, but is responsible for compliance with any agreement with the payment method provider.

Furthermore, the Organiser has the ability to use the Ask to Buy function, which requires children under 18 to obtain permission from the Organiser or other designated adults before downloading free or paid products. However, products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. The passage emphasizes that Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite, and earlier software may present alternative permission processes or prevent purchases altogether. iTunes is not responsible for any harm resulting from delays in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.
This passage outlines the requirements and guidelines for using the iTunes Service. It states that in order to use the service, users must have compatible devices, internet access, and certain software. High-speed internet access is recommended, especially for film rentals. Users are responsible for meeting these requirements, which may change over time. The passage also emphasizes that the service is separate from any other product or offering, and purchasing other products does not guarantee access to the service.

The passage then discusses the importance of account security. Users are advised not to share their account information with anyone else and are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their account. Any unauthorized use of the account should be immediately reported to iTunes. To purchase and download iTunes products, users must enter their Apple ID and password or use Touch ID for authentication. Once authenticated, users do not need to re-enter their password for fifteen minutes. However, users have the option to require a password for every transaction or turn off the ability to make transactions altogether.

The passage also mentions automatic delivery and downloading of previous purchases. Users can choose to automatically receive copies of purchased iTunes content on additional compatible devices. The content will auto-download on devices with push notifications, while on devices without push notifications, it will appear in the download queue for manual initiation. Users are also allowed to download previously-acquired content onto associated devices. However, there are limitations on the number of associated devices and iTunes-authorized computers. Free content can be downloaded onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free, but on no more than five iTunes-authorized computers.
This passage provides information about the usage and limitations of Apple TV and iTunes Match. It states that Apple TV is not considered an "Associated Device" but can be used to play back TV shows and purchased movies from iTunes, with a limitation on the number of Apple TVs that can be used simultaneously. It also warns that some iTunes content may be large and result in significant data charges when delivered over a data connection.

The passage then explains iTunes Match, which allows users to remotely access their matched or uploaded songs, music videos, playlists, and other information about their iTunes Library. Users must subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee, which will automatically renew unless canceled. The service works with libraries containing up to 25,000 songs that are not currently available on iTunes or not purchased from iTunes. iTunes Match scans song files and collects information to match songs with those available on the iTunes Store. If a song is not successfully matched, the user's copy will be uploaded to iTunes. iTunes Match content can be accessed from Associated Devices and compatible Apple TVs, with limitations on the number of devices that can be used simultaneously.

The passage also mentions that when using iTunes Match, Genius will associate information about the media in the user's iTunes library with their Account. This association will continue for a period of time after the subscription ends. It states that iTunes Match should only be used for lawfully acquired content and warns against using illegitimate content, which may result in civil and criminal penalties for copyright infringement. The passage concludes by mentioning that iTunes Match is provided on an "AS IS" basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies, and that users should back up their data before using the service. It also refers to Apple's Privacy Policy for information on privacy.
This passage discusses the Genius feature offered by Apple. When users opt in to this feature, Apple collects information from their iTunes library, such as play history and playlists, in order to provide personalized recommendations. This information is stored anonymously and not associated with the user's name or account. Apple may also combine this information with aggregated data from other users who have opted in, as well as purchase history data and information from third parties, to create personalized playlists and provide recommendations for media and other products and services.

Users have the option to enable or disable the Genius feature at any time. If they choose not to enable it, Apple will not collect or use information from their iTunes library in this manner. By opting in, users consent to the use of their information as described and in accordance with Apple's Privacy Policy. The passage also mentions that iTunes reserves the right to change content options without notice and that the iTunes Products are provided to users through a license, with certain usage rules and restrictions.

The passage concludes by outlining the usage rules for iTunes Products. Users are authorized to use these products for personal, noncommercial use and can store them on up to five different devices. They can also burn an audio playlist up to seven times and use the burned CD in the same way as a retail store-bought CD, subject to copyright laws. However, burning video iTunes Products is only allowed for backup purposes and these backups can only be played via the iTunes application.
This passage outlines the terms and conditions for using the iTunes Service. It states that users are able to submit materials and links to third-party content on the Service, but they are responsible for ensuring that these materials do not infringe on the rights of others or violate any laws. By submitting materials, users grant iTunes a license to use them as part of the Service without compensation. iTunes reserves the right to not post or publish any materials and to remove or edit any material at its discretion.

The passage also mentions that iTunes has the right to monitor materials submitted by users and to take action if there is a violation of the agreement.

The accuracy of product types and descriptions is not guaranteed.

The passage emphasizes that the Service and its content are protected by intellectual property laws and that users are not allowed to use this proprietary information or materials in any way except for using the Service in compliance with the agreement. Users are not permitted to modify, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the Service. iTunes reserves the right to change or remove any content or materials offered by the Service without notice. The copyright in the Service belongs to iTunes and its licensors, and unauthorized use may result in civil and criminal penalties.
This passage is a section of the terms and conditions agreement for iTunes. It states that if a user breaches the agreement, they will be held liable for any claims arising from the breach and for any actions taken by iTunes during their investigation. iTunes also reserves the right to modify the agreement at any time and impose new terms or conditions, which will be effective immediately and incorporated into the agreement. If a user refuses to accept these changes, iTunes has the right to terminate the agreement.

The agreement also states that it governs the user's use of the service and supersedes any prior agreements. The user may also be subject to additional terms and conditions when using affiliate services, certain iTunes products, third-party content, or third-party software. If any part of the agreement is held invalid, the remaining portions will still be in effect. iTunes is not responsible for failures to fulfill obligations due to causes beyond its control.

The service is operated by iTunes from its offices in Luxembourg, and the user agrees to comply with all applicable laws. iTunes may notify the user through email, postal mail, or a posting on the service. iTunes also has the right to take steps to enforce and verify compliance with the agreement, including disclosing registration data and account information to law enforcement authorities or third parties if necessary.

The passage also introduces the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store, stating that iTunes is the provider of these stores. Users can purchase licenses for software products and digital book content from these stores. The requirements for using the stores include being at least 13 years old, with accounts for those under 13 being created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing. The stores are only available in the United Kingdom, and iTunes may use technologies to verify compliance with this restriction.
This passage outlines several important aspects of using the App Store and Mac App Store. Firstly, it explains that your device or computer will periodically check for updates to the apps on your device, and if available, these updates may automatically download and install. However, you have the option to turn off automatic updates at any time. 

The passage also mentions the concept of App Bundles, which are packages that contain multiple items. The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing it, and the price may be reduced if you have already purchased or acquired some of the items included in the bundle.

Privacy is addressed in the passage, stating that the Stores are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy can be found on Apple's website.

The passage also explains that when you purchase a product from iTunes, you are actually purchasing a license to use the product. This license forms a binding agreement between you and the publisher of the product. The usage of products is subject to certain rules established by iTunes and the publishers, and any other use may constitute copyright infringement. iTunes reserves the right to modify the usage rules for future purchases, but these changes will not apply to products you have already purchased.

The passage also emphasizes the importance of content security and store security. Users are not allowed to violate or tamper with the security framework of the products, and violations may result in enforcement actions by iTunes. Access to the stores should only be done through software provided by Apple, and unauthorized access may result in legal consequences.

Lastly, the passage mentions that the stores may offer interactive features for users to submit materials, but users are responsible for ensuring that their submissions do not infringe on the rights of others or violate any laws. iTunes has the right to remove or edit any materials submitted by users.
This passage outlines the scope of the license granted to the user for the Licensed Application. The license allows the user to use the application on Apple-branded products running iOS or Mac OS X that they own or control, as long as it is in compliance with the Usage Rules set forth in the Mac App Store, App Store, and iBooks Store Terms and Conditions. The license does not permit the user to use the application on Apple devices that they do not own or control, and it prohibits the distribution or availability of the application over a network for multiple devices to use simultaneously. The user is also not allowed to rent, lease, sell, transfer, or sublicense the application, and if they sell their Apple device, they must remove the application from it.

The passage also includes a section on the user's consent to the collection and use of data by the Licensor. The user agrees that the Licensor may collect technical data and related information about their device, system, and application software to facilitate software updates, product support, and other services related to the Licensed Application. The Licensor may use this information to improve its products or provide services, as long as it does not personally identify the user.

The passage further discusses the termination of the license, stating that it is effective until terminated by the user or the Licensor. If the user fails to comply with any terms of the license, their rights will automatically terminate without notice from the Licensor. In such cases, the user must cease all use of the Licensed Application and destroy all copies of it.

Lastly, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application may enable access to external services and websites. The use of these external services requires internet access and may require the user to accept additional terms. The user acknowledges that they may encounter offensive or objectionable content while using these services and that the Licensor and its agents are not liable for such content. The passage also states that the Licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content, accuracy, legality, or quality of third-party materials or websites accessed through the Licensed Application. These materials and links are provided as a convenience to the user.
This passage outlines the terms and conditions for using the Licensed Application and iBooks Store Products. It states that the Licensor has the right to warn, suspend, or terminate access to the External Services if there is a suspected violation of the agreement. It also mentions that the Licensor is not liable for any loss of income, business, or profits, or any loss or corruption of data resulting from the use of the Licensed Application. However, the Licensor's liability is not limited in cases of fraud, gross negligence, wilful misconduct, or death or personal injury caused by negligence.

The passage also includes restrictions on the use and export of the Licensed Application. It states that the application can only be used and exported in accordance with United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained. It cannot be exported to U.S.-embargoed countries or to individuals on certain U.S. government lists. The user must also agree not to use the products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including the development of weapons.

Furthermore, the passage mentions that the Licensed Application and related documentation are considered "Commercial Items" and are being licensed to U.S. Government end users with the same rights as other end users. The license and use of the Licensed Application are governed by English laws and may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.

In addition to the terms and conditions for the Licensed Application, the passage also includes information about the license and usage rules for iBooks Store Products.

The publisher is responsible for the product, its content, any warranties, and any claims related to its use. The passage also outlines the usage rules for iBooks Store Products, including limitations on personal, noncommercial use, the number of devices on which the products can be stored, and the restrictions on promotional use and burning the products to disc.
This passage discusses the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from an iTunes-authorised device to other devices. It states that this can be done as long as the iBooks Store Product is associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is defined as the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.

In simpler terms, this passage is saying that users have the ability to manually sync iBooks Store Products from one iTunes-authorised device to other devices. However, there are certain conditions that need to be met for this to happen. The iBooks Store Product must be associated with an Account on the primary iTunes-authorised device. The primary iTunes-authorised device is either the device that was first synced with the other device or the one that is designated as primary using iTunes.

Overall, this passage is explaining the process of manually syncing iBooks Store Products and the requirements for doing so. It provides a clear definition of the primary iTunes-authorised device and emphasizes the importance of having the iBooks Store Product associated with an Account on this device.
