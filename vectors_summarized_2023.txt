This section of the Apple Media Services Terms and Conditions outlines the agreement between the user and Apple regarding the use of Apple's Services. The Services include various platforms such as the App Store, Apple Arcade, Apple Books, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News, Apple News+, Apple One, Apple Podcasts, Apple Podcasts Subscriptions, Apple TV, Apple TV+, Apple TV Channels, Game Center, and iTunes. These Services allow users to purchase, license, rent, or subscribe to content, apps, and other in-app services.

To use the Services, users must have compatible hardware, software, and internet access. The performance of the Services may be affected by these factors. Users can acquire content on the Services either for free or for a charge, which is referred to as a "Transaction." Each Transaction is an electronic contract between the user and Apple and/or the entity providing the content. In some cases, Apple Distribution International Ltd. acts as the merchant of record for certain content acquired from Apple Books, Apple Podcasts, or the App Store.

When making a Transaction, users are asked to choose how frequently their password should be required for future Transactions. Users can also enable Touch ID or Face ID for authentication. Apple will charge the user's selected payment method for paid Transactions, including applicable taxes. Multiple payment methods can be associated with the user's Apple ID, and Apple may store and charge those payment methods for Transactions. The primary payment method is displayed at the top of the user's account settings payments page.
This section of the contract discusses payment methods and the process for canceling an order. It states that if your primary payment method cannot be charged for any reason, Apple will attempt to charge your other eligible payment methods in order. If they are unable to charge you, you are still responsible for any uncollected amounts and they may request another payment method. If you pre-order content, you will be charged when it is delivered unless you cancel before it becomes available. Apple may also automatically update your payment information if provided by the payment networks or financial institutions.

The passage also mentions that content prices may change at any time and if there are technical problems with delivery, you can either receive a replacement or a refund. However, Apple reserves the right to suspend or cancel payment or refuse a refund request if there is evidence of fraud, abuse, or unlawful behavior.

The section also outlines the right of cancellation. Customers have 14 days from receiving their receipt to cancel their order without giving a reason. To cancel, customers can inform Apple through the "Report a Problem" feature or by using the model cancellation form provided. The cancellation must be sent before the 14-day period expires. If the cancellation is made within the specified time frame, Apple will reimburse the customer within 14 days using the same payment method used for the transaction. However, there is an exception to the right of cancellation if the delivery of content has already started at the customer's request.
This section of the contract outlines the terms and conditions for using Apple's Services and accessing your Content. It states that in order to use these services, you will need an Apple ID, which is the account used across Apple's ecosystem. It is emphasized that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account, and Apple will not be held responsible for any losses resulting from unauthorized use. If you suspect that your account has been compromised, you are advised to contact Apple.

The section also specifies that in order to create an account and use the services, you must be at least 13 years old or the equivalent minimum age in your Home Country. If you are under this age, a parent or legal guardian can create an account for you using Family Sharing or through an approved educational institution. It is recommended that the parent or legal guardian review the agreement with the minor to ensure understanding.

The contract also mentions the option to add, notify, or remove a Legacy Contact for your Apple ID, with the limitations of access described in the provided links. It then goes on to state that your use of the Services is subject to Apple's Privacy Policy, and provides a link to access it. Finally, the section outlines the Usage Rules for the Services and Content, emphasizing that any other use is considered a breach of the agreement. It covers various rules such as using the Services and Content for personal, noncommercial purposes, limitations on the number of devices and Apple IDs that can be used, prohibition of manipulating play counts or reviews, responsibility for backing up downloaded Content, and not tampering with security technology or modifying Apple's software. It also mentions that video content requires an HDCP connection.
This section of the contract outlines the terms and conditions for using digital content on Apple devices. Users are allowed to use DRM-free content on a reasonable number of compatible devices that they own or control. DRM-protected content can be used on up to five computers and any number of devices that are synced to those computers.

Content rentals are limited to viewing on a single device at a time and must be played within 30 days. Once playback starts, it must be completed within 48 hours. Burning audio playlists of purchased music to disc is allowed up to seven times, but this limitation does not apply to DRM-free content. Other content cannot be burned to disc.

Purchased content will generally remain available for download, redownload, or access from Apple. However, there is a possibility that content may be removed from the services, making it unavailable for further download or access. To ensure continued access, users are encouraged to download all purchased content to a device and back it up.

The section also covers specific rules for different types of content. For App Store content, apps and in-app purchases can be downloaded and used on multiple devices owned or controlled by an individual or an enterprise. Apple Music allows streaming on a single device for individual memberships and up to six devices for family memberships. Apple Arcade apps can only be downloaded or redownloaded with a valid trial or subscription, and access to downloaded apps ends when the subscription ends. For Apple TV content, most channels allow streaming on up to three devices simultaneously.

There are also limitations on the amount of content that can be downloaded, and some downloaded content may expire after a certain amount of time. Users may be able to redownload previously acquired content to associated devices, but this is subject to availability. Content may also be removed from the services at any time, making it inaccessible for download or redownload.
This section of the contract discusses subscriptions, content and service availability, and the use of third-party devices and equipment. 

Regarding subscriptions, users have the option to purchase access to content or services on a subscription basis. These paid subscriptions automatically renew until cancelled by the user. If the price of a paid subscription increases, the user will be notified and their consent will be required to continue. The user will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the start of the latest subscription period. If the payment method cannot be charged, the user remains responsible for any uncollected amounts. Apple reserves the right to cancel a paid subscription if the payment method cannot be successfully charged.

In terms of content and service availability, certain terms in the agreement may not be applicable to the user's home country unless they become available. Users can check the available content types in their home country on the services or Apple support website. Some services and content may not be accessible when traveling outside of the home country, unless required by law.

When using non-Apple-branded devices, users may not be able to access all features of the services. Additionally, certain services may require or suggest the use of third-party equipment, which should be used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Apple may also automatically download and install minor updates to its software on third-party equipment.

Overall, this section of the contract provides information on subscriptions, content and service availability, and the use of third-party devices and equipment. It outlines the terms and conditions related to paid subscriptions, access to content, and the limitations when using non-Apple devices.
This section of the contract discusses two main topics: submissions to Apple's services and family sharing. 

Regarding submissions, users are allowed to submit materials such as comments, ratings, reviews, pictures, videos, and podcasts through Apple's services. However, these submissions must comply with Apple's submission guidelines, which may be updated periodically. Apple reserves the right to remove any materials that violate these guidelines. Users are also granted a worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the materials submitted within the services and for internal purposes. Apple may monitor and edit submitted materials as necessary.

In terms of family sharing, the organizer of a family must be at least 18 years old and the parent or legal guardian of any family member under the age of 13. Family sharing allows eligible subscriptions and content to be shared among up to six family members. The organizer is responsible for inviting other members to participate and agrees to pay for all transactions initiated by family members. The organizer's payment methods are used for these transactions, except when the family member has store credit. Family members are considered agents of the organizer when using the organizer's payment methods. The organizer is responsible for complying with payment method contracts and assumes all risks associated with sharing access to their payment methods. Receipts or invoices for family member transactions are sent to the initiating family member and, if billed to the organizer's payment method, also to the organizer.
This section of the contract discusses three main topics: Ask to Buy, Family Member changes, and Family Sharing Rules. 

Ask to Buy is a feature that allows an Organizer, who must be the parent or legal guardian, to approve transactions initiated by a family member under the age of 18. However, content shared by family members or acquired via content codes is generally not subject to Ask to Buy, except for content codes that provide access to subscriptions. Ask to Buy is automatically enabled for family members under the age of 13 and stays on until deactivated by the parent or legal guardian. Once a family member turns 18, Ask to Buy cannot be turned on again. It is important to note that Ask to Buy does not require Purchase Sharing to be enabled.

When a family member leaves or is removed from the family, the remaining family members may no longer have access to the former member's content, including content acquired with the organizer's payment method. This means that if a family member leaves the family, their content will no longer be accessible to the other family members.

Family Sharing Rules state that an individual can only belong to one family at a time and can join a family no more than twice per year. Additionally, the Apple ID associated with a family can only be changed once every 90 days. All family members must share the same home country. Not all content, including in-app purchases, subscriptions, and some previously acquired apps, are eligible for purchase sharing. However, certain subscriptions such as Apple TV+, Apple Music Family, and Apple Fitness+ are automatically enabled for family sharing. It is important to note that subscriptions shared by a family may have content usage limitations on a per subscription basis.

The last part of the passage briefly mentions Series Pass and Multi-Pass. A Series Pass allows the purchase and receipt of television content as it becomes available, while a Multi-Pass applies to television content that is available on an ongoing basis. The full price of a Series Pass or Multi-Pass is charged at the time of the transaction. Series Pass or Multi-Pass content is available for download up to 90 days after the last episode becomes available. If a content provider delivers fewer TV episodes than planned when a Series Pass is purchased, Apple will credit the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes that were not provided. 

Overall, this section of the contract provides information on Ask to Buy, Family Member changes, Family Sharing Rules, and Series Pass/Multi-Pass for television content.
This section of the contract explains the relationship between Apple, the App Provider, and the user. Apple acts as an agent for the App Providers in operating the App Store and is not directly involved in the sales contract or user agreement between the user and the App Provider. However, if the user is a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., they acquire the App license from Apple Distribution International Ltd., but the App itself is licensed by the App Provider. There are two types of apps: Apple Apps, which are licensed by Apple, and Third Party Apps, which are licensed by the App Provider. The App Provider is solely responsible for the content, warranties, and claims related to Third Party Apps.

The section also discusses In-App Purchases, which are content, services, or functionality that can be purchased within the app. In-App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the app cannot be transferred among devices and can only be downloaded once. Users must authenticate their account before making In-App Purchases, and there is a fifteen-minute window where additional purchases can be made without re-authenticating. The ability to make In-App Purchases can be turned off if desired.

Apple is responsible for providing maintenance and support for Apple Apps, while App Providers are responsible for providing maintenance and support for Third Party Apps. Some Apps may be sold together as a bundle, and the price displayed for an App Bundle is the price the user will be charged. The price may be reduced if the user has already purchased or acquired some of the apps in the bundle.

Lastly, the section briefly mentions how search results and rankings are determined in the App Store. The main parameters considered include the metadata provided by App Providers, customer engagement with the Apps and the App Store, and the popularity of the Apps. These parameters aim to deliver the most relevant results to customer search queries.
This section of the contract discusses the use of external services in the licensed application. The user agrees to use these external services at their own risk, and the licensor is not responsible for examining or evaluating the content or accuracy of these services. The data displayed by the licensed application or external services is for informational purposes only and is not guaranteed by the licensor. The user is not allowed to use the external services in a manner that infringes on the intellectual property rights of the licensor or any third party, or to harass, abuse, stalk, threaten, or defame any person or entity. The availability and appropriateness of the external services may vary, and the user is responsible for complying with applicable laws. The licensor reserves the right to change or restrict access to the external services without notice.

The warranty section states that the licensor will use reasonable care and skill in providing the licensed application and any external services. However, the licensor does not make any other promises or warranties about the external services. They do not guarantee that the user's use of the external services will be uninterrupted or error-free, or that the services will be free from loss, corruption, attack, viruses, interference, hacking, or other security intrusions. The user is responsible for backing up their own system, including any licensed application stored on it.

The limitation of liability section states that the licensor, its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, principals, or licensors will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the licensor or its employees or agents, except in cases of fraud, gross negligence, willful misconduct, or death or personal injury caused by negligence. The licensor is not liable if there is no breach of a legal duty of care, if the loss or damage is not a reasonably foreseeable result of a breach, if the increase in loss or damage is a result of the user's breach of the agreement, if it results from the licensor's actions during the investigation of a suspected violation or as a result of a violation of the agreement, or if it relates to loss of income, business, profits, or loss or corruption of data in connection with the user's use of the licensed application.
This section of the contract outlines several important terms and conditions regarding the use and export of the Licensed Application. Firstly, it states that the user is only authorized to use the application in accordance with the laws of the United States and the jurisdiction in which it was obtained. The application cannot be exported or re-exported to U.S.-embargoed countries or to individuals listed on certain U.S. government lists. By using the application, the user confirms that they are not located in any restricted country or on any restricted list, and they agree not to use the application for any purposes prohibited by U.S. law, including the development of weapons.

Next, the section addresses the use of the Licensed Application by U.S. government end users. It states that the application and related documentation are considered "Commercial Items" and are licensed to U.S. government end users with the same rights as other end users, in accordance with applicable regulations. The copyright laws of the United States also reserve certain unpublished rights.

Lastly, the section discusses the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes arising from the agreement. It states that the agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, and any disputes or claims should be resolved in the courts located within Santa Clara County, California. However, if the user is not a U.S. citizen, does not reside in the U.S., and is accessing the service from a country listed, the applicable law and jurisdiction will be determined by the user's usual place of residence. The United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods is specifically excluded from application to this agreement.

Overall, this section of the contract provides important information regarding the authorized use and export of the Licensed Application, the rights of U.S. government end users, and the governing law and jurisdiction for disputes.
This section of the contract discusses various terms and conditions related to the use of Apple Books, App Store, Apple Podcasts, Apple Music, and Apple Fitness+. It clarifies that when you acquire content from these platforms, Apple acts as an agent for the third-party content provider, and therefore, Apple is not a party to the transaction between you and the content provider. However, if you are a customer of Apple Distribution International Ltd., they are considered the merchant of record for the content you acquire. The content provider is solely responsible for the content, any warranties, and any claims related to the content.

The passage also explains the features and terms of iCloud Music Library, which allows you to access your matched or uploaded songs, playlists, and music videos on Apple Music-enabled devices. It mentions that iCloud Music Library collects information about your content and associates it with your Apple ID. It also logs information about your usage, such as the tracks you play, devices used, and playback duration. It emphasizes that iCloud Music Library should only be used for lawfully acquired content and may contain errors or inaccuracies. If you are not an Apple Music member, you can purchase an iTunes Match subscription to use iCloud Music Library. However, when your Apple Music membership ends, you will lose access to your iCloud Music Library.

Additionally, the section briefly mentions Apple Fitness+, stating that it is for entertainment and informational purposes only and should not be relied upon for medical advice. It advises seeking the advice of a qualified healthcare professional for any safety concerns or specific medical conditions or symptoms. The section concludes with a mention of Carrier Membership, but no further details are provided.
This passage of the contract discusses several important terms and conditions related to the use of services provided by Apple. Firstly, it mentions the option to purchase a Service membership from a wireless carrier, known as a Carrier Membership. If a user chooses to purchase a Carrier Membership, their carrier becomes the merchant of record and will bill them for the cost of the membership. However, it is clarified that the Service itself is licensed and provided by Apple. Any billing disputes related to a Carrier Membership should be directed to the carrier, not Apple. By using a Service through a Carrier Membership, the user agrees to allow their carrier to exchange their account information with Apple.

The passage also includes miscellaneous terms applicable to all services provided by Apple. It defines Apple differently depending on the user's home country, specifying the relevant Apple entity for each region. This ensures that users are aware of the specific entity they are entering into an agreement with based on their location.

Lastly, the section discusses the termination and suspension of services. If a user fails to comply with the provisions of the agreement or if Apple suspects non-compliance, Apple has the right to terminate the agreement, terminate the user's Apple ID, preclude access to the services, and terminate the user's license to the software. The user will still be responsible for any outstanding amounts due under their Apple ID.
This section of the contract outlines Apple's rights to modify, suspend, or discontinue their services at any time without notice to the user. Apple will not be held liable for exercising these rights. They will make an effort to warn users in advance of any changes, but termination of the service will not affect any content that the user has already acquired.
